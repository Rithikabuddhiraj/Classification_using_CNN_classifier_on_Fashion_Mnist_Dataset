# 👗 Classification using CNN on Fashion MNIST Dataset

This project demonstrates how to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset and deploy the model using a Flask web application.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

- **Dataset**: Fashion MNIST – A dataset of 28x28 grayscale images of 10 clothing categories.
- **Model**: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built using TensorFlow/Keras.
- **Deployment**: Flask-based web app where users can upload an image and receive a predicted clothing class.
- **Frontend**: Simple HTML (`index.html`, `result.html`) for user interaction.

## 🧠 Model Architecture

The CNN model includes:
- Convolutional layers with ReLU activation
- MaxPooling layers for downsampling
- Flatten and Dense layers
- Softmax output for multiclass classification (10 classes)

## 🖥️ How to Run the Project Locally

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rithikabuddhiraj/Classification_using_CNN_classifier_on_Fashion_Mnist_Dataset.git
   cd Classification_using_CNN_classifier_on_Fashion_Mnist_Dataset
````

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. Then:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Flask App**

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. **Open in Browser**
   Go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your web browser.

---

## 🧪 Sample Prediction Flow

1. User uploads a clothing image via the web form.
2. Image is preprocessed and fed to the CNN model.
3. Model returns a predicted class (e.g., "T-shirt", "Sandal").
4. Result is displayed on `result.html`.
